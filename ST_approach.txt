For my symbol table I decided to use the same DLB that was used when executing the -find argument.
The first time a password is searched the allPasswords.txt file is read through and the DLB is
generated. All subsequent passwords are searched for through the DLB. The DLB is has an efficient 
lookup time for the passwords, since every password is guarenteed to have some matching prefixes.
Besides that, since I already had the logic implemented to create a DLB, it made it easier to
just reuse that logic when looking through the file.
